#Documentation of MeshBee Project by Julien Romero

This document will present and explain my work during my semester project. The goal is to build a wireless network of sensors for performance analysis. I began the project in February 2016. I hope that thanks to this document you will be able to understand what I did, why I did it and to continue my work.
