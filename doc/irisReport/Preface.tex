\section*{Preface}

My work took place in the MSRL Lab in 2016. First, I would like to thank George Chatzipirpiridis and Alessandro Sch√§r for their precious advice which made the project possible. Then, I would like to thank all other people in the lab who helped me by introducing me to the workshop or by giving me good ideas.
I hope my work will be useful to others after me.
