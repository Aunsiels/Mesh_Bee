\section{Summary and Contributions}
\label{s:SummaryAndContributions}

During the semester project, a flexible and scalable network of sensors was design. We proved that any kind of sensor connected by I2C can be easily integrated to the system. Moreover, using HTML pages makes it very simple to visualize data because of the high number of resources available and because nowadays, all phones have a web navigator integrated. At the end, we also partially solved the problem of time synchronization by analyzing different methods to compensate drift.

\subsection{Future Work}
\label{s:FutureWork}

The project can be mostly extend in the use cases. We have created a easy-to-use framework with a lot of explanations on how to use it. Choosing what to do with it is the next step. It could be use for players monitoring in a sport team, smart home, smart city,...

On a more technical side, improvement can be done. The python script should be rewritten in C. On the server side, there is work to do with web design and how to display data in a meaningful way. On the hardware side, specialized design could be done, depending on the use case. As the design of MeshBee is open source, it can be easily modified.
